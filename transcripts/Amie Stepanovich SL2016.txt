   ALEX MILLER: I spent a lot of time looking for interesting keynote speakers that may be somebody that you haven't heard of, and I'm really happy to have her here today to talk to you about government hacking. I'm happy to introduce Amie Stepanovich from Access Now.
   [applause]
    AMIE STEPANOVICH:  Psychotic, cruel, vicious.  These are words that were used to describe Nicodemo Scarfo, and my talk today begins where, in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, Scarfo ended up with a life sentence. A computer that was able to be breached when FBI agents installed a keylogger that enabled him to get his password and bypass his encryption.
   Nicodemo's keylogger was installed.
   We don't have a lot of information about these early days of FBI hacking. Most of what we do have are some random facts like that eventually the FBI and that was used to monitor an animal rights group. Most of what we know comes because wired, thanks to the great reporters at Wired, they did a Freedom of Information Act request and they were able to get a bunch of documents about early FBI hacking activities. One of the key documents was a 2002 memo that talked about a computer and internet address validater. The memo accused agents of overusing the tool and they said that it was unnecessarily raising difficult questions and a risk of suppression without any countervailing benefit.
   There's even less information about this time available through the courts. Even though that we knew that these tools, what the FBI now calls network investigative techniques, were used in cases involving bomb threats, criminal fugitives, and child pornography. But for the most part, we have to assume that when judges were involved at all, that they just greenlit FBI requests to use hacking tools.
   But recently, just in 2013, the FBI finally hit its first roadblock. Judge Steven Smith, a magistrate in Texas, denied the FBI to use a NIT in a case involving bank fraud. Judge Smith said that the request didn't comply with the rules of -- So I'm going to take a second -- I'm going to dig into both of these objections that Judge Smith raised about FBI hacking, the procedural objections, and the constitutional.
   Rule 41 is the federal rule of criminal procedure that talks about searches and seizures. It governs when magistrates can issue warrants in certain jurisdictions for law enforcement to conduct these activities. And it has only a few exceptions to the rule that basically magistrates can only issue warrants for searches that are going to occur within their jurisdiction. Some of these exceptions like a tracking warrant which means that a search can start in one jurisdiction and even if a criminal defendant leaves that jurisdiction it doesn't have they can track that car across jurisdictions and don't have to go back to a different magistrate.
    The problem is right here in the case name. The FBI had no idea where the computer it wanted to search was located.
   And this was a huge issue for Judge Smith. He basically said that he had no jurisdiction to enter this warrant, because he didn't know if they were going to comply with the standards for Rule 41.
   The FBI put forward a lot of arguments, they really tried to convince Judge Smith that this was OK, and that this could occur, but Judge Smith threw all of their arguments out the window and flat denied their application to hack into this computer.
   Now, you'd think that that would stop the FBI, but it didn't for long, and just in a few months the acting Assistant Attorney General issued a memo calling for greater amendments to Rule 41 to change it to allow this type of activity to occur. That memo was sent to the advisory committee on criminal rules, it's this really obscure committee that not many people know about, and the people looked at the memo and said yes, we can do this, and they issued a lot of draft amendments and those amendments did a lot of things.  And they said there would be another exception to the limitation, in order to search a computer, if the judge did not know where that computer was located, so long as some sort of harm was felt in the judge's jurisdiction. 
   Now, advocates felt that this was putting the cart before the horse, basically because there is no statutory authority, no substantive statutory authority, for the FBI to engage in hacking operations. 
   Congress has never considered this, they've never talked about it, they've never issued a statute saying that the FBI can do this. Which is really strange, because Congress often talks about the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the law which governs which law enforcement can get access to electronic communications.  
   Within ECPA is the Wiretap Act. These are warrants that have an increased standard from other types of surveillance. They require, for example, that the surveillance is limited to certain criminal activity, and they require proof that traditional investigative techniques have not been successful, or are too dangerous to attempt.
   And this was put forward because wiretapping supposedly is more invasive than these traditional techniques, but I would argue that hacking is more invasive than that. It gains access to both stored and live data. It can impact people who are not targets or it can damage property. It interferes with human rights, which we'll get to in a little bit. And it's also incredibly invasive for the people whose property might be seized during they operations.
   This means that it requires even more safeguards, we think, than what is necessary for wiretapping. But Congress hasn't done that. They haven't put those safeguards into place, so ECPA, a law that is already, by the way, wildly out of date for the purposes that it was intended to be used for, having been passed in 1986, is now being stretched in order to allow it to approve activity that was not even dreamt about when it was passed.
   When the federal advisory committee on criminal procedure considered these rules, my organization, Access Now, along with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the ACLU, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, we all provided testimony to the committee. We flagged that there was no statutory authority for government hacking, that it was probably unconstitutional, and that the CFAA, a federal law that the activity was being tied to, was already far, far too broadly interpreted, way outside the measures for which it was passed.
   Unfortunately, much like the honey badger, the committee did not care.
   [laughter]
   It went ahead and approved the rules anyway. And just earlier this year, the Supreme Court also approved those rules.
   This means that they're now sitting in Congress, and unless Congress affirmatively acts to either delay or to prevent the rules from taking effect, they're going to do so in about six weeks. This turns the lawmaking process on its head. Typically you imagine that Congress has to act for something to happen. This happens as long as they do nothing.
   And so it's taken about three years, but it looks like the FBI is about to gain incredibly, incredibly broad authority by pushing through a procedural rule without ever, ever having to talk about the substance.
   So what about the constitutionality, the other issue that Judge Smith flagged?
   Now, I'm going to assume there's a lot of you, but I'm going to assume that most of you know that the 4th Amendment is the part of the Constitution that talks about privacy. It is the right of the people, it says, to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, and that right shall not be violated, and no warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and -- and this part is really important -- particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. This last part is known as the particularity requirement of the 4th Amendment.
   Now, Judge Smith's opinion on the constitutional issues and on particularity is really important to dig into here, because for a really long time, he was the only judge that actually had issued an opinion on the constitutionality of government hacking.
   Smith said that the government's application contains little or no explanation of how the target will be found. He keyed his decision to the fact, as I explained earlier, that the FBI did not know where the computer was located. He asked questions about if the computer was going to be in a library, in an internet cafe, or in a home where a lot of people lived, and he said, there may well be sufficient answers to these questions, but the government's application does not supply them.
   It's also important to look at the government's tools when we talk about constitutionality. The year before the Smith case, the government tried to engage in hacking activity and it had to reapply with the court three separate times, because its tools kept acting in unpredictable and unplanned ways. Its final tool, the third tool it finally got to return two IP addresses in that case, was also flagged by the court, because it reportedly did not execute properly, that's their words.
   The year after the Smith case, the court actually engaged in what we call a drive-by hacking operation, meaning that it installed malware, not only on criminal content, content like child pornography that it's a crime just to accrue, but also on legitimate websites, meaning it was collecting information about totally innocent internet users.
   Now, the ACLU, I had said, also testified with us, when we went in front of the federal committee and they flagged some of the constitutional issues and so I'm going to go ahead and turn to them, and their words, to explain to you some of these constitutional issues.
   First, they said, if the government configures a website or server to deliver malware to the computer of every person who visits it, it will likely end up searching the computers of people it cannot particularly identify or describe and to whom it lacks probable cause. 
   Issuing a search warrant offering the surreptitious malware into computers of an unknown number of targets raises serious legal and policy questions, moreover, even if orders for bulk installation of malware are deemed to be proper, the vast majority of websites that the government might commandeer will be visited by both legitimate targets and non-targets alike. So what this activity actually looks like what we call a general warrant, and in the time when the Constitution was drafted, general warrants was basically the most repugnant activity. 
   I will to my dying day oppose, with all the powers and faculties God his given me: It appears to me the worst instrument of arbitrary power, the most destructive of English liberty, and the fundamental principles of law that was ever founded in an English law book, so these things are really bad, and the government's activity is anything but particular. 
   It talks -- it would touch upon large populations of users, by allowing them to receive the malware by just visiting a website. So it looks like at least for now, that the constitutionality argument is on pretty solid ground, that we're pretty much in a good place arguing that this activity is not constitutional.
   But it acts as -- now we realize -- and I'm guessing you are also realizing -- that the internet is a global technology, and so when we were trying to figure out what was happening with government hacking we knew that we had to look abroad, as well, or our analysis was just going to be totally totally inadequate.
   So we talked a little bit about the United States. You guys guess what countries I'm going to next?
   Australia, actually. Earlier this year, it was reported that Australia had engaged in an operation in order to track the IP addresses of every single user visiting a website called Love Zone, a child pornography website. 
   It was unclear what authority they were using to do this, but Australia actually has one of the oldest laws authorizing hacking on the books. In 2014, it actually expanded its hacking authority, it can now conduct bulk hacking operations. Now, the idea of bulk hacking terrifies me. I don't really know what it is. It's basically like if countries install malware in a security update, that would be a bulk hack. It impacts everyone.
   Amongst other things that Love Zone investigation actually resulted in evidence that Australia turned over to the FBI and was used in the United States to indict users.
   So now I'm going to go where you thought. China and Russia were described by Newsweek last year as being the most sophisticated cyberwarfare actors. APT1, a Chinese group that you probably have all heard of for a long time, has been in the headlines recently because of the DNC hack. They've been operating since about 2006 are the earliest records that we have. Russia's biggest hacking incident was in 2007, when they hacked into the Estonian government's computers. In 2014, when Russia hosted the Olympics, the US State Department actually learned that users should expect zero privacy in Russia.
   And that risk became reality, because security experts actually demonstrated that the Russian government likely was totally owning devices within minutes of them being powered on.
   So many other countries. Germany has been engaged, the BND, their intelligence agency, in hacking since about 2011 and their Police Department has engaged in hacking since 2009, plus since 2001. The United Kingdom officially acknowledged that it was hacking in 2015, when it released a code of conduct on what they called equipment interference, which is double speak for government hacking. That document was finalized in 2016. Although there are reports that they have been hacking for much, much longer than that.
   In 2016, just this year, Italy was found to be installing hacking tools on mobile phones to bypass encryption. France has now passed a law that allows them to hack into devices and the United Arab Emirates was found to have purchased a tool that allowed it to hack into a human rights activist, simply because the government did not like what that activist was saying.
   Which brings me to the idea that governments are not doing this on their own. They're actually contracting with people who are providing them the tools to do this.
   Ha 2015 data breach from Hacking Team, which is really kind of the biggest provider of these tools, or has been historically, revealed that they were selling tools to Italy, Korea, Turkey, Mexico, India and Colombia, among others. One of their most major clients was actually Egypt which has a terrible human rights record and has also been documented buying hacking tools from a lot of other companies.
   Moreover, there are international hacking operations. Operation Onymous and Warrior Pride is a hacking program that was revealed in this note in documents. United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. We've talked about the expansions to Rule 41, the United Kingdom is also probably right at this moment as I'm speaking talking about their investigatory powers bill, which will formalize their ability to conduct hacking operations and recently and while Hacking Team has clearly suffered a few setbacks, there are a lot of companies compete be to be the preeminent provider. So stepping back and looking at this glob picture, we realized how woefully inadequate domestic frameworks are. And we really that really what we need to do is look at international law and try to figure out international standards, safeguards and norms with the basis of human rights that could protect users against government activity.
   So really, what are human rights?
   Human rights are not necessarily things you can say. They're things you innately possess by the virtue of being born, however, there are a lot of documents that try to set these out. They cannot provide you with human rights, but they can guarantee them, they can identify them, and they can let you know when governments can or cannot interfere with them.
   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights has been around since 1948, it's received really broad support from governments all over the world and it's kind of the initial document we go to when we talk about human rights. The standard in the UDHR have been used in other documents like the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights and the European Declaration on Human Rights.
   But before we go further, why don't we take a step back. So I come from Washington, D.C. Is there anybody else from DC here?
    AUDIENCE:  Yeah!
   >> I have to try to explain these really complex topics and I'm not a technologist. I'm a lawyer. I'm sorry. I always feel the need to apologize when I say that.
   And so I talked to our tech team at Access Now, and what we came up with were these three broad categories that we could fit most hacking operations into and that I with way we don't have to go through every single tactic, technique, tool, all of the different nitty-gritty details in the ways governments can hack. Instead we were looking at what the governments were trying to accomplish and we were dividing it into message control, causing damage, and surveillance.
   So messaging control is basically what happens when the governments change the messaging in text messages or emails, mess with a domain name system to go from one website and redirect you to another surreptitiously or actually deface the website to change the content on that website.
   Causing damage, what the Tallinn Manual would call a cyber attack is what happens when either external or internal damage is caused by a hacking operation, so think for example if a gun was made to shoot at a target that it wasn't necessarily intended to shoot at. You know, that would never happen, clearly. That would be in the causing damage category. Also in this category is if data, in databases was changed and made to be unreliable in some way.
   And the final category is perhaps the best-known. Maybe where most hacking operations that we know about have taken place, and that's the commission of surveillance or intelligence gathering. This includes both directly gathering information, as well as undermining encryption standards or protocols in order to facilitate the easy gathering of information.
   Now, because hacking is really, really invasive, all of these activities undermine human rights. And so a little bit of human rights terminology: When something messes with human rights, we say that it interferes. with that right.
   And hacking interferes with a lot of rights, and I'm going to talk about three. The is due process. Due process is really important, because it basically provides the protections to make sure that other human rights are respected.
   And due process is really messed with in a lot of ways by government hacking. First, we totally get rid of notice. Any idea that there is overt notice from hacking activity is taken away or surveillance activity is taken away in government hacking. Furthermore, hacking can damage property without any remedy, without any process, meaning it can deprive you of your property rights. It can also damage the internet infrastructure that we all have come to rely on. Documents revealed that the NSA caused damage when it was trying to monitor the internet in Syria, it inadvertently shut down the entire internet. This is -- can we get audio?
     "You might crash the system. It's a dangerous thing. When you hack a system, you don't actually know what's going to happen. You might crash the system. And so I'm just looking at my iPad over here, an update to Twitter, not an app that was written by some teenager in her garage someplace, for some users, the app crashed on launch. Well, you figure Twitter tested their app, but for some people, it wasn't working. A few weeks ago, Apple issued updates for iPads. Guess what. If you had an iPad Pro, it might have bricked it, completely and utterly and permanently disabled the device. Apple certainly tested their software. Update 8.0, I believe it was, to iOS iPhones. Some people could no longer make phone calls. They tested, but testing doesn't always catch everything, because every computer is different. Different operational characters, different apps, different usage patterns. When you hack something, you're talking the risk that you're going to damage the device."
   So clearly causing damage is a huge problem here, and not necessarily the intentional damage, the damage that government set out to create in that category, but damage that is totally unintentional that happens as a result of the tool or technique being deployed in a way that's not foreseen.
   Privacy is another human right that hacking deals with and probably the one we're most aware of. Notably, when we talk about interfering with the right to privacy, what we're talking about is protected information, so that means either public or private information, but it can also mean public information if it's analyzed or put together in a way that reveals private details about you. So if somebody goes through my public Twitter feed and puts it -- applies an algorithm to it that's able to determine secret details about who I am, probably things that I don't even know, that would be protected information and that's what we're concerned about in the right to privacy.
   Finally, the last major human right interfered with by government hacking is the freedoms to expression, opinion, and association. Frank Laroux who was the United Nations Special Reporter: It clearly violates an obligation to the express the right of freedom of opinion and expression.
   So then what are the rules to government hacking?
    We looked through all of these international laws, the court cases and international courts, and related topics, things like eminent domain, and tried to see if we could pull out some rules for the road on government hacking to be applied internationally.
   So the first thing we realized is that there's needs to be a presumptive prohibition on government hacking activity and before you scoff, that doesn't mean it can never happen. It means that in order for governments to justify hacking operations, they need to show that there are safeguards in place and that they're going to do it in respect -- with respect to human rights. Now, that's going to be specifically pretty difficult in some of these categories and it might not be possible. Categories like message control and causing damage where the risk of harm is especially great, government hacking might not be able to occur. We might just need to prohibit it outright. Looking at eminent domain. That bolsters that conclusion. But when we looked at surveillance, we realized that it wasn't so clear cut and that it might be possible for governments to hack in order to conduct surveillance in line with human rights, but in order for them to do that, it needs significant safeguards, the type of safeguards that no government, not the United States, not anyplace all over the world has ever put into place. These safeguards are set out in the international principles on the application of human rights to communication surveillance, which is a mouthful and we just call them the principles.
   Because who wants to say that? So let's recap. We have talked about the fact that government hacking is taking place. We've talked about the fact that it's probably going to take place, despite the fact that there's really a huge failure in communicating or in talking about what that activity should look like. We've talked about the need to apply human rights standards to government hacking and how to apply those standards, and that when you look at it, that we need to probably put in place a presumptive prohibition on government hacking and then we've said that that prohibition might be able to be rebutted if there are really significant safeguards in place in order to protect users against the government. So I'm going to finish today and talk a little bit about what we think those safeguards look like. We've set out ten. First is that we need a law, that law needs to be clearly written, publicly available, and it needs to explain exactly when government officials will have the authority to seek authorization to engage in hacking.
   When they do that, when they file an application to engage in hacking, we think that they should have to specify what categories of information they're seeking. And that that hacking activity should never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever be performed with discriminatory purpose or effect.
   After we've got that law in place, we need to talk about standards and make sure we're using the right ones. Officials should explain why it's necessary to use hacking operations, to get information, and that they cannot access that information through other legal means.
   And that means that if there's information that they can only get through hacking, but that other information they can get through other activities, they should engage in those other activities for the information, and only use hacking for limited categories.
   An application for government hacking should identify what devices are being targeted. It should provide a specific time period when the hacking will take place, and it should be designed to only return those specific necessary categories of information.
   And if any extra information is collected on accident, clearly, because they never collect extra information on purpose, it should be deleted.
   And bulk hacking we think should be prohibited. It essentially impacts the entire internet infrastructure and causes damage that can be felt globally and so we feel that bulk hacking needs to be outright prohibited. Applications for government hacking should be properly reviewed and approved but an independent and competent judicial authority. Now, judges don't really understand necessarily what technology does. They don't often have smartphones, even. A lot of them still use old flip phones. So that means judges need to be supplied with experts that can provide them information on the possible ramifications of government hacking and the risk of unintended consequences.
   So at a minimum, they should have access to these technical experts. We'd prefer that this happen in an outright adversarial process, but that's just not how systems of surveillance tend to work and importantly, government hacking should be different in other types of surveillance in a key way and that's that a lot of surveillance is allowed to happen in emergency situations and we think that there should always be prior approval of these operations.
   Now, transparency is the hardest part. And it's probably the part that people in favor of government hacking bristle the most at. Current hacking -- or current surveillance practice all over the world basically says that even when notice is required by law in different countries, that they can withhold it and some of them do withhold it indefinitely.
   But it's the most important part because of the increased risk of harm.
   We feel like applications eventually need to be filed publicly, although it's not necessarily necessary, for governments to disclose the exact tools that they're using and that notice may be delayed, so long as it's in conjunction with human rights protections.
   We also think that officials should, to the extent possible, and we note that it won't always be possible, but they should monitor how their tools are being deployed, and keep track of the status of the tool and if it operates in ways that are unexpected, they should report that back to the judicial authority.
   Private entities should never, ever be compelled to assist governments to hack into their own products and services in ways that undermine user security and can be that somebody even in cases like the Apple example in San Bernardino, but also where companies are under polite requests by government to put in standards and practices that would make hacking easier.
   And finally the reason for that collection should be studied and judges should be provided with explanation and future measures that will prevent it from happening again.
   Extra territorial government hacking should not occur unless it's illegal in both jurisdictions, not just where it starts, and not just where it ends. And finally, and this is probably the most hotly debated issue that I'll bring up, because unpatched vulnerabilities create global riching, once discovered or received, they should be properly disclosed to a developer. Delay should be possible. Yes, thank you. Delay should be possible, but it should be in extraordinary circumstances.
   Routine public reports of when those delays happen need to be made, and they need to identify exactly what justification governments are using. Now, none of this is easy. Having this conversation has not been easy. There are those that I know who would say that government hacking should never occur ever in the history of the world and in all of the future to come. And there are people who think that it should occur with no transparency, no safeguards, and no oversight at all. And I have been yelled at by both sides of that equation. And human rights -- but human rights should not be sacrificed at the altar of government hacking and human rights aren't the only equities at issue here. Hacking can harm property, it can harm the internet, it can harm other rights, as well. But if we don't hack, really dangerous people could continue to run free, men like Nicodemo Scarfo. Because I believe hacking probably isn't going away any time soon, it's going to be important for decades to come that we get this conversation right and we get it right right now.
   So thank you very much, thanks to the organizers and if you have any questions, I'd be happy to take some of them.
   [applause]
   >> There's one up top, if you can scream.
   >> What do you think about the globalization of internet frameworks, like right now in we've got US giving up dot-com.
   >> I believe you're talking about the IANA transition. We have been in favor. We think it's a net positive. It's going to be a positive thing for human rights. There's a lot of misinformation out there about what's going to happen because of that. We've been trying to remedy that a little bit. We have a few blog posts up on our website. We recently signed on to a letter. Happy to point you to some more resources if you're more interested in that topic.
   >> There's one down here. Gray looks like.
   >> Do you think that making the government liable for damages is [inaudible]
   >> So the question was about trying to make the government hacking for their damage caused during hacking operations, we think that might be necessary, actually. Not necessarily all of the time. Specifically when they intend to occur damage or when they do it negligently or when they do it accidentally and then use the same tool again and again. You need to do that monitoring to make sure that tool is working. This comes from a paper that we just published. And initially we tried to think about if we could require the government to monitor how their tool was impacting non-targets and to try to provide notice to non-targets that they might have been impacted by hacking tools, that maybe their computer had been owned. And realized that that just wasn't possible, but we think that there needs to be some sort of check to have the government staying answerable to people, that it doesn't -- it shouldn't be hacking at all.
   >> And there was another one over here.
   >> Rule 41(b) specified that the location, the jurisdiction doesn't have to be local if efforts are taken to hide the location of the computer, or if there are computers more than five different jurisdictions. Those seem like reasonable updates to a law in 2016. Can you tell me what the problem is?
   >> Sure, so the question specified the different changes to Rule 41, which I didn't go into. There are a couple of changes about notice that aren't relevant here, but basically they say it's an exception to the rule that says if the government wants to hack, it doesn't have to be in the jurisdiction where the computer is, A, they don't know where it is, and there has been some effort to hide the location, or if there has been harm within the definition of the computer fraud and abuse act, and computers are located in five or more jurisdictions.
   So each one of them, we think, is overbroad. The first one's actually specifically targets for people for using VPNs, it means that the government can forum-shop you if you use a VPN. Does anybody here use a VPN? I expected that much.
   >> That means that the government can go to any court in order to get a warrant to hack into your computer and forum shopping is a real threat and it's not only just to determine the location. There has been a alternative proposal to limit this search to just getting location and then requiring them to go to the right court in the right jurisdiction to get the rest of the warrant to get other information. That has been kicked out. That's not going to be in the amendment. It also is going to allow global hacking, which is something that nobody is really clear what the standard should be, but it means if computers are located outside the US, the government will be able to hack into them. The second change, the five or more jurisdictions, there are again a few problems, the first is that the CFAA has been interpreted way overbroadly which means there are a lot of things that are harm within the definition of the CFAA. The changes, specifically, though, getting at bot nets and what it wants to do is allow the government to be able to search the computers of bot net victims, not the computer of the person -- not trying to go up, but trying to get into their computers. Every technologist I've talked to, and I'm more than happy to hear from those in this room during the rest of the conference, has been really confused about why they need this authority, that there are other ways to take down bot nets without doing this, Susan L, Steven Belivan who you saw on the screen have all questioned on why this is necessary. They seem to think this isn't a good change, either.
    AUDIENCE:  So I write private location services and I worry about that [inaudible] the government asking me nicely to give them data. What would be your advice to people like me in the audience for when that -- the nice response comes?
   >> So the question was, what do you do when the knock on the door comes from the government asking very politely for you to turn over information. Sometimes it's alter your service in a way. It's all different things. First of all, is these non-legal requests, these like voluntarily, hey, do this. Aren't legally binding, so you can challenge those. You don't have to do T you -- if it is legally, if it's a court request, you can challenge that. We've seen people like the Halex Institute challenge court orders, we've seen Yahoo challenge orders. We've seen Apple challenge the government trying to do this,  so you can stand up. It is difficult, we know. There are people who will help you do that. And I encourage you to reach out to those people. There are a lot of lawyers, I am happy to names of lawyers after this that will give legal advice, but I don't feel like it might be prudent to do that in an audience of this size.
   [laughter]
   >> Right down front?
   >> Are there sort of similar organizations in say like Australia and the UK or Europe that you can recommend? Because obviously these people are --
   >> Great, so the question is it where do you go if you're not in the US? So great question. Access Now is now international. We have offices in Brussels, Costa Rica, the Philippines, India, all over the world. There are people that are happy that we work with. The European digital rights is a group of a lot of organizations in Europe, as well as an organization itself, that can provide help. Electronic frontiers, Australia, it depends on your location, there are groups all over the world working on these issues and they are happy to provide you more information both about what you can do in regard to what has already happened and how to object to things that are upcoming. For example, if any of you are from the UK? you should be really, really really hard-pressing to get rid of the :
   >> Any women, questions?
   >> Anyone?
   >> All right, so many of these surveillance tactics have been used to monitor marginalized people, especially when it comes to people of color, women, ethnic groups, that kind of thing and many boundaries are set up internally to prevent illegal surveillance of, say, for instance, your ex, but those boundaries are often violated and the system isn't really set up to create repercussions for people who violate those, so what hope do marginalized people have to get justice in a system like this?
   >> So the question what hope do marginalized people have to get justice in a system that's kind of set up against them? Is that?
    AUDIENCE:  Yes.
   >> We really feel like first of all there seems to be so much more oversight put in place on government activities and other activities that impact users. There's a tremendous lack of oversight. We are oversight tends to occur, actually is when we start to get information about things, and they like trying to figure out how we are getting information, which is backward. We think that actually, again, when we say that, we think that these activities should be monitored and reported back to a judge, we think that there should be repercussions, both for the agency that allows this to happen, but also for the individual agents if it's a flat-out refusal to comply with these limitations. It happens way too often. This is another reason we object to this VPN use. Activists, journalists, there are people, victims of domestic violence, there are people who need to protect where they are located and they shouldn't have to give up legal rights because they don't want to reveal to the world their location and to anybody who can sniff their wifi where they're operating out of and the government is turning that on its head and using that as evidence of wrongdoing and those people aren't doing anything wrong. I can take one more question if there's one.
   >> [inaudible]
   >> So there are -- the question was how do you deal with companies who willingly collude with government. There's been a lot of shareholder advocacy. There's an amazing project run by Rebecca McKinnon out of new America that is actually trying to go to companies and see how much they are complying with human rights standards and if collusion is happening. It's done amazing work so far in getting responses from companies on this issue.
   >> So I think that's it for time. Thank you, thank you so much. I really appreciate all of you sitting here with me ...
   [applause]
   >> Thank you so much, we've got about ten minutes passing time until the next talks. Thank you and have a great day.
